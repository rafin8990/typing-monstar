    <h1 class="question-one" > Question One: What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
    <h3>Answer: </h3>
    <p>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB and The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.
        As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually and session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, until the browser (or tab) is closed.
        The client  can only read local storage.A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab.
