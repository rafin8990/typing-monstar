                        As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually and session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, until the browser (or tab) is closed.
                        The client  can only read local storage.A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab.</div>

                        When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function it was called as Block Scope. A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop are called Global Scope.
                        var is called as Global scope that is if a variable is declared using var keyword it will be accessible throughout the function.let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular block. Here let is used for variable which can be changed as we proceed through the program whereas const is used for a variable which doesn't change till the program ends, that is it remains constant throughout the program.</div>

                        The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.Event Queue is a special queue, which keeps track of all the functions queues, which are needed to be pushed into the call stack. The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. The queue data structure is required to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.

                        An undefined variable or anything without a value will always return "undefined" in JavaScript. This is not the same as null, despite the fact that both imply an empty state.8 ways to get undefined & that is describe in the below: <br>

                        1.When a variable is declared or initialized but no value is assigned to it, JavaScript automatically displays "undefined". <br>
                        2.when you try accessing values in, for example, an array or object that doesn't exist, it will throw undefined. <br>
                        3.The property that does not exist in the object give us undifined. <br>
                        4.If we get only return but return doesn't back us anything give us Undefined. <br>
                        5.If we declare something after declaring return in a function and that should give us Undefined. <br>
                        6. Anything that has been set to the value of undefined. <br>
                      7. Any expression in the form of void(expression) <br>
                      8. The value of the global variable undefined
